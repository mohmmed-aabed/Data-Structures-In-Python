# Data Structures and Algorithms In Python

This repository contains the implementation of the main Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.
You can find also solutions for some interview questions related to Data Structures and Algorithms.

Every single line in this repository has been written by me.

I have learned most of these concepts through (Python for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews) course, so I would like to thank Mr. Jose Portilla and appreciate what he is doing to simplify the programming knowledge.
